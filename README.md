# 📘 The Momentum Audit & Reclaimer

### *A productivity playbook for product teams—and the execs who support them*

---

## 👋 Why This Workbook Exists

In post–product-market-fit (PMF) startups, **momentum is everything**.

What separates high-growth startups from their stalled peers isn’t just funding, talent, or marketing. It’s the strength of their internal operating rhythm—how well **executive strategy** and **product execution** stay in sync without friction.

This workbook exists because that rhythm is breaking down.

> Meetings, once meant to align and accelerate, are now clogging calendars, draining energy, and stalling decisions across every level of the organization.
